High Elasticity:
    Your ability to automatically increase or decrease your capacity based on the current demand of traffic, memory, and computing power.
    This is accomplished using horizontal scaling or scaling out. 

    Vertical Scaling is generally hard for traditional architecture so you'll usually only see horizontal scaling described with Elasticity.


Azure VM Scale Sets: Automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule.

SQL Server Stretch Databases: Dynamically stretch warm and cold transactional data from Microsoft SQL Server 2016 to Microsoft Azure.
