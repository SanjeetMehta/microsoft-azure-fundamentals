Resource groups:

Both Azure and AWS have entities called "resource groups" that organize resources such as VMs, storage, and virtual networking devices. 
However, Azure resource groups are not directly comparable to AWS resource groups.

While AWS allows a resource to be tagged into multiple resource groups, an Azure resource is always associated with one 
resource group. A resource created in one resource group can be moved to another group, 
but can only be in one resource group at a time. Resource groups are the fundamental grouping used by Azure Resource Manager.

Resources can also be organized using tags. 
Tags are key-value pairs that allow you to group resources across your subscription irrespective of 
resource group membership.
