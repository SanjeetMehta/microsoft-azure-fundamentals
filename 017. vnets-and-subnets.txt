Azure Virtual Network(vNet) and Subnets

vNet:
    It is a logically isolated section of the Azure Network where you launch your Azure resources. You choose a range of IPs using CIDR range.
    CUDR range of 10.0.0.0/16=65536 IP addresses

Subnets:
    It is a ligical partition of an IP network into multiple smaller network segments. You are breaking up your IP range for vNet into smaller networks.
    Subnets need to have a smaller CIDR range than to the vNet representation their portion.
    eg: Subnet CIDR range 10.0.0.0/24 = 256 IP addresses.

    A Public Subnet: It is one that can reach the internet.
    A Private Subnet: It is the one that cannot reach the internet.
