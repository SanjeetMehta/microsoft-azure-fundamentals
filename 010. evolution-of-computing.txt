Dedicated -> VMs -> Containers -> Functions

Dedicated:
    A physical server wholly utilized by a single customer.
    You have to guess your capacity, you'll operpay for an underutilized server.
    Upgrading beyond your capacity will be slow and expensive.
    You are limited by your operating system.
    Multiple apps can result in conflicts in resource sharing.
    You have a gurantee of securoty, privacy, and full untility of underlying resources.

VMs:
    You can run multiple VMs on one machine.
    Hypervisor is the software layer that lets you use/create VMs.
    A physical server shared by multiple customers.
    You only pay for a fraction of the server.
    You'll operpay for an underutilized VMs.
    Limited by Gues OS.
    Multiple apps on a single VMs can result in conflicts in resource sharing.

Containers:
    VMs running multiple container.
    Docker Deamon is the name of the software layer that lets you run multiple containers.
    You can maximize the utility of the available capacity which is more cost-effective.
    Your containers share the same underlying OS so containers are more efficient than multiple VMs.
    Multiple apps can run side by side without being limited to the same OS requirements and will not cause conflicts during resource sharing.

Functions:
    A managed VMs running managed containers.
    Knows as serverless compute.
    You uplaod a piece of code choose the amout of memory and duration.
    Only responsible for code and data, nothing else.
    Very cost-effective, only pay for the time code is running, VMs only run when there is code to be executed.
    Cold starts is a side-effect of this setup.
