Serverless:
    When the underlying servers, infrastructure, and OS is taken care of by the cloud service provider. It will generally be
    highly available, scalable,and cost-effective.

Event driven scale:
    A serverless function can be triggered or trigger other events allowing you to complex applications and it just scales.

Abstraction servers:
    Servers are abstracted away. Your code is described as functions. These functions can be running on different compute instances.

Micro-billing:
    Serverless compute could run on a fraction of a second. Billing into microsecods will save you money.


Services:
    Azure functions. Supported languages, C#, java, JS, Python, and powershell.
    Blog storage: Serverless object storage, just upload files and don't think about underlying sile systems, resizing.
    Logic Apps: Allows you to build serverless workflows composed of Azure functions building a state machine for serverless compute.
    Event grid: Use pub/sub messaging system to allow you to react to events and trigger other Azure clouds and Azure functions.
